# Get To Know Me

Hey there! My name is Eduardo Arias Mendez. A little bit about me, I'm 22 years old, I'm originally from El Salvador but I now live in Houston, TX. I'm currently a senior in Middlebury College, majoring in MBBC (Molecular Biology and Biochemistry). My hobbies consist of exercising, watching shows and films, dancing, and watching soccer.
